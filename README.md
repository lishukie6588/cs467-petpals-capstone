# PetPals

Welcome to the public repo for the PetPals app development. 

## What is PetPals?

PetPals is an animal “dating” application that will work to best pair potential adopters to animals listed for adoption at the animal shelter. Potential adopters and shelters will be asked to create an account with the application for either users or administrators respectively. Users will be able to read daily news feeds from the shelter and browse through adoptable animals based on their species, breed, and/or disposition such as if the animal is good with children, other animals or their leashing needs.
